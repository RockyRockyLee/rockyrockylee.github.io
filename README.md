* RSS subscribe and site search, with source code from [Skydark's blog][]
* Sina Weibo pay-attention button
* Abstract of posts in home page (it cannot be seen in github for its plugin-disabled)
* Declaration at end of each post
* My personal-like style
* Friend Links

## Function that will be realized

With this blog, I will write something about programming, programmers and some of my life  
I hope I would not give up updating this blog
